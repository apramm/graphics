CREATIVE COMPONENT

(1) GENERAL COMMENTS

It was a fun part as I got to think a lot about what represents british columbia and tried to add some components that could be created manually in javascript and others could be imported. I wanted to try and learn vertex shader but had difficulties implementing it hopefully, would learn it later in the course!

(2) A FEW THINGS I LEARNED WHILE WORKING ON THE CREATIVE COMPONENT

- I learned about how to create multiple 3-D Alphabets manually using coordinate system.
- I learned to use the 3-D models that are easily on internet
- I learned how to position multiple attributes in a model which makes the scene beautiful
