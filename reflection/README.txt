FURTHER COMMENTS:


BRIEF ASSIGNMENT SELF-ASSESSMENT:

  We learned a lot of things like writing custom fragment and vertex shader as well
  as making use of time in changing to animate object's fragments as well as making water in in the scenario to augment 
  using noise dicarding for puddling and mixing refraction and reflection.
  We definitely struggled with making water scene more realistic but with the time given we definitely learned a lot.
